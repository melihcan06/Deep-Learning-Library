# Deep-Learning-Library

I am trying to develop a simple deep learning library.I am still developing this library.I want to use different optimizers (rmsprop,adam,sgd with momentum (m > 0)...) and loss functions (categorical cross entropy,...) in future.I may have made a few mistake.If you catch a mistake please feedback to me.
