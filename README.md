# Deep-Learning-Library

I am trying develop a simple deep learning library.This is still developing not finished.I want to use different optimizers (rmsprop,adam,...) and loss functions (categorical cross entropy,...) in future.I may have made a mistake.If you catch a mistake please feedback to me.
